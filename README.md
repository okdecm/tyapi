## Introduction
### Why?
For years I've wasted hours writing boilerplate code for my API's - from design, implementation, to consumption.
Along this journey I've faced the same frustrating hurdles - mismatched typings, code duplication, lack of documentation.
This has resulted in countless bugs, lost motivation, to full rewrites.

### How?
Tyapi's goal is to simplify your API journey by creating contracts that can be used across your whole stack.

### When?
We are in our alpha stage of development.
Starting as a passion project by Dec Murphy, tyapi has seen many iterations.
During our alpha stage we will release our core functionality, allowing you to compose and consume your own API contracts.
This will include both the client and server orchestrators.

## Philosophy
### Agnostic
At its core, Tyapi is implementation agnostic.
This means it has no dependencies on runtime/third party frameworks.

> Native fetch or Axios?
> Express or Fastify?
> HTTP or WebSockets?
_It doesn't matter._

Tyapi is built to compliment these solutions, not replace them.
